# Predictive-Analytics-with-R
Algorithm to choose the best method (Naive, Simple Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA) for predicting time series thanks to accuracy function. If **x is provided, the function measures test set forecast accuracy based on **x-f. If x is not provided, the function only produces training set accuracy measures of the forecasts based on f["x"]-fitted(f).
